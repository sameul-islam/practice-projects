##  Project Description  

I have created 20 medium-sized projects here, which I practiced and built myself to improve my skills. I started my journey of learning web development in early 2025. Having completed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript courses, I worked on these projects to apply and reinforce what I learned.

Although I have practiced many other things besides these projects, I am only including these here for now, with plans to implement more in future websites. While working on these projects, I faced various challenges and problems that taught me a lot. I never considered any problem a setback; rather, I saw them as blessings. Every time I encountered an issue, I made sure to learn from it — and I did.

For assistance, I relied on documentation from MDN and W3Schools. Whenever I faced difficulties, I searched for solutions there and on Google to resolve my problems. Through practicing these projects, I aimed to make JavaScript my native language — and I have been fairly successful so far. However, I continue to strive to learn what I do not yet know. I am always eager to learn new things and make sure to approach learning in a highly professional manner.

I have written the code for these projects to be clean, professional, and easy to understand for others. Still, there may be occasional mistakes since I am still at the early stages of my journey. I am ready to learn from any errors and improve over time.

All these projects have been tested and are functional. However, some projects that use APIs may not always work properly because they use fake or test API keys. For example, the news website project uses an API key, which might cause it to not run consistently. If you replace it with a valid news API key, it should work as expected.

Similarly, if any other API in these projects stops working, updating the API with a new key should resolve the issue.

Feel free to use these projects in your own work or modify them as you like. If you find any mistakes or areas for improvement, please let me know. These projects are mainly practice exercises, so there is plenty of room for further development.

I created all these projects entirely through my own effort without copying from anywhere. Below, I have provided live links to each project — please feel free to click and explore them.

Thank you very much for taking the time to read this.
