# About This Project
This project took me a significant amount of time to complete. Throughout the development process, I faced various challenges that tested my problem-solving abilities and pushed me to grow as a developer.

While writing this code, I often encountered roadblocks. During those times, I relied heavily on the MDN Documentation and, occasionally, Google to help me understand and overcome the issues. These experiences taught me a lot and helped me improve my skills, ultimately making me a more professional and confident developer.

I have tried my best to keep the code as simple, clean, and professional as possible so that anyone reviewing it can understand everything just by looking at it. Additionally, I have included comments throughout the code to help readers clearly understand the logic in their own language.

Thank you so much for taking the time to read about my project. I truly appreciate your interest.
