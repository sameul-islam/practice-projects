# simple-quiz-app
This project is mainly a part of my personal practice.
Today I practiced and completed this project, and Iâ€™ve learned a lot from it.
I faced several difficulties while building it, but I managed to solve them with the help of MDN documentation.
The purpose of this project is to allow users to select the correct answer to a question.
A question is displayed with four options â€” if the correct one is clicked, the score increases by 1.
Thereâ€™s still room for many improvements and new features, but for now, Iâ€™m keeping it simple as a part of my learning journey.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my project!
