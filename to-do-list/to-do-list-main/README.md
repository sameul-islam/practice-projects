# About to-do-list
This project is essentially a To-Do List built entirely based on my own experience.
While working on it, I encountered numerous challenges.
Whenever I got stuck, I relied heavily on W3Schools and MDN Web Docs for guidance.

I tried my best to maintain clean and professional code throughout the project.
This project is a part of my learning journey and practice process.
Each obstacle I faced taught me something new and helped me understand things more deeply.

Thank you for taking the time to read about my code.
